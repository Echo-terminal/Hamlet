# Hamlet Webpage Project

This project is a simple HTML-based webpage dedicated to William Shakespeare's "Hamlet." It was created as an assignment for a university course to showcase skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The webpage includes various sections that provide information about the play, display excerpts in both English and Russian, and feature a video player with custom controls.

## Project Structure

### HTML (`index.html`)

- The main HTML file is organized into several sections:
  - **Header**: Contains the navigation menu and the title of the webpage.
  - **Welcome Section**: Introduces "Hamlet" with a thought-provoking quote by Belinskiy V. G.
  - **About Section**: Provides detailed information about the play, including its history and significance.
  - **Reading Section**: Displays excerpts from "Hamlet" in both Russian and English, with links to full versions of the text.
  - **Film Section**: Contains a video player with a clip related to "Hamlet" and custom controls.

### CSS (`style.css`)

- The CSS file is responsible for the layout and styling of the webpage:
  - **Fonts**: The webpage uses three fonts from Google Fonts: "Forum," "Open Sans," and "Playfair Display."
  - **Responsive Design**: The design adjusts for different screen sizes with media queries for devices with widths less than 1440px and 1080px.
  - **Styling**: Includes custom styles for the navigation, text formatting, and various sections of the webpage, as well as a custom video player.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)

- The JavaScript file handles the interactive features of the webpage, particularly the custom video player:
  - **Play/Pause Functionality**: Controls playback of the video.
  - **Progress Bar**: Updates the progress bar as the video plays and allows the user to seek within the video.
  - **Volume Control**: Allows the user to adjust the volume and mute/unmute the video.
  - **Skip Buttons**: Lets the user skip forward or backward by 30 seconds in the video.
  - **Fullscreen Mode**: Enables fullscreen viewing of the video.

## Features

- **Custom Video Player**: The video player includes play/pause, volume control, skip forward/backward, and fullscreen toggle functionalities, all implemented with JavaScript.
- **Bilingual Text Display**: Excerpts from "Hamlet" are shown in both Russian and English, providing a comparison for readers.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring it is accessible on various devices.

## Usage

To view the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The links in the Reading Section will direct you to full versions of "Hamlet" in Russian and English, and the video in the Film Section can be controlled using the custom player controls.
